# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [2.31.2] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **Settings panel grouped into labelled sections** — the Dashboard's *Settings* foldout now has three bold sub-headers (**General**, **Port**, **Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM)**) instead of an unlabelled flat list. The *Start on Virtual Players* toggle is now under the explicit **MPPM** header so its scope is clear, and it was moved below the Port settings. UI-only change, no behaviour difference.

## [2.31.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **MPPM scenario commands now work on MPPM 2.0 (Unity 6)** — the 2.31.0 Unity 6 port resolved the scenario types under the wrong names. In MPPM 2.0 the scenario "config" ScriptableObject was renamed `OrchestratedScenario` (from `ScenarioConfig`) and the status struct `ScenarioStatusData` (from `ScenarioStatus`); `MCPScenarioCommands` now resolves both. `create_scenario` no longer requires the removed `RemoteInstanceDescription` type (remote instances were dropped in MPPM 2.0), and `list_scenarios` reads instance counts from `OrchestratedScenario`'s fields. All MPPM tools verified end-to-end on Unity 6000.5.0b8 + MPPM 2.0.2.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **MPPM Virtual Player management** — new commands `mppm/list-players`, `mppm/activate-player`, `mppm/deactivate-player` to list and activate/deactivate Multiplayer Play Mode virtual players by 1-based index.
- **`scenario/create`** — create an MPPM `ScenarioConfig` asset programmatically (one Main Editor instance + N Virtual Editor instances with configurable Host/Client/Server roles).

### Changed
- **MPPM scenario commands now work on Unity 6** — `MCPScenarioCommands` resolves the MPPM scenario types from both the legacy package assembly (`Unity.Multiplayer.PlayMode.Scenarios.Editor`, pre-Unity-6) and the built-in `UnityEditor.MultiplayerModule` introduced in Unity 6; previously all `mppm/*` commands returned "MPPM is not installed" on Unity 6. `scenario/start` / `scenario/stop` also enter/exit Play mode so virtual-player launch hooks fire.

## [2.30.0] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **MCP settings are now scoped per project / per instance** — `EditorPrefs` is global to the machine, so settings were previously shared across every Unity project and instance (e.g. one project's manual port leaked to all others). `MCPSettingsManager` now namespaces keys into two tiers: **instance-scoped** (`Port`, `UseManualPort`, `AutoStart` — keyed by project path, unique per main Editor / ParrelSync clone / MPPM virtual player) and **project-scoped** (`StartOnVirtualPlayers`, project context, action-history and category settings — keyed by `PlayerSettings.productGUID`, shared by a project and its clones / virtual players). Existing settings are migrated to the new keys automatically on first load.

## [2.29.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **MPPM Virtual Player detection on Unity 6** — `MCPScenarioCommands.IsVirtualPlayer()` (the gate behind the 2.29.0 "Start on Virtual Players" setting) only resolved the pre-Unity-6 type `Unity.Multiplayer.Playmode.CurrentPlayer`. On Unity 6 that API moved to `Unity.Multiplayer.PlayMode.CurrentPlayer` in the built-in `UnityEngine.MultiplayerModule`, so detection always returned false and the gate never engaged. It now resolves both locations (Unity 6 first, pre-6 fallback). Verified live on Unity 6000.5 with MPPM.

## [2.29.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **"Start on Virtual Players" setting** — new MCP settings toggle controlling whether the bridge auto-starts on Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM) virtual players. Previously every virtual player launched its own MCP bridge, which is usually unwanted noise. Default is **on** (behaviour unchanged); turn it off so only the main Editor runs a bridge. Virtual players are detected via `Unity.Multiplayer.Playmode.CurrentPlayer.IsMainEditor`; manual start on a virtual player still works. Addresses [unity-mcp-server#21](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/21).

## [2.28.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Manual (fixed) port not reclaimed after a domain reload** — with a manual port configured, `MCPBridgeServer.Start()` bound the port directly and gave up permanently on the first failure. Right after a domain reload the port can be briefly unbindable while the previous listener's socket is released; auto-port mode already survived this (it probes and falls back) but manual mode had neither probe nor retry. `Start()` now retries the same manual port up to 10 times on a 0.5s delay before giving up. Addresses [unity-mcp-server#10](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/10).

## [2.28.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Unity 6.5 (6000.5) compatibility** — The plugin compiles and runs on Unity 6.5. The InstanceID APIs deprecated as compile errors in 6.5 (`Object.GetInstanceID`, `EditorUtility.InstanceIDToObject`, `SerializedProperty.objectReferenceInstanceIDValue`, `AssetPreview.IsLoadingAssetPreview(int)`) are now routed through a version-gated `MCPObjectId` shim — it uses `EntityId` with `EntityId.ToULong`/`FromULong` on 6.5 and the classic APIs on 2021.3–6.4. Fixes [#14](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/issues/14) and [unity-mcp-server#24](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/24).

### Changed
- **`instanceId` is now a string** — Unity 6.5 entity ids are 64-bit values that exceed JavaScript's safe-integer range (2^53), so as JSON numbers they were rounded crossing the Node MCP server and object-by-`instanceId` resolution failed. The JSON `instanceId` field is now a decimal string on every Unity version (opaque, lossless). Requires `unity-mcp-server` ≥ 2.28.3.

## [2.27.2] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Roslyn assemblies not found on macOS** — `MCPEditorCommands.TryLoadRoslyn()` assumed the Windows/Linux `Data/` editor layout; on macOS the assemblies live inside `Unity.app/Contents/`, so `unity_execute_code` always failed with "Roslyn is not available". The lookup now detects the `.app` bundle and adds `Unity.app/Contents` as a data root, plus `Tools/ScriptUpdater`. Contributed by [@dougfy](https://github.com/dougfy) in [#13](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/pull/13).

## [2.27.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **UPM install compile failure (`CS0103` cascade)** — `MCPPrefsCommands`, `MCPConstraintCommands` and `MCPProfilerCommands` shipped `.cs.meta` files with hand-typed placeholder GUIDs. Under a UPM git install (`Library/PackageCache/`), Unity 6 silently skipped indexing those scripts, cascading into `CS0103` errors. The three GUIDs were regenerated with proper random values. Fixes [#11](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/issues/11). Contributed by [@BadranRaza](https://github.com/BadranRaza) in [#12](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/pull/12).

## [2.27.0] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Path-based lookup for inactive GameObjects** — `MCPGameObjectCommands.FindGameObject` now passes `FindObjectsInactive.Include` to `FindObjectsByType<GameObject>`. Every tool routed through path-based lookup (`prefab_info`, `set_active`, `info`, `delete`, `set_transform`, `reparent`, etc.) now works correctly on inactive GameObjects, whereas they previously failed with "GameObject not found". Fixes [unity-mcp-server#16](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/16). Contributed by [@BadranRaza](https://github.com/BadranRaza) in [#8](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/pull/8).
- **Prefab-instance detection on scene instances** — `MCPPrefabCommands.GetPrefabInfo` now uses `PrefabUtility.IsPartOfPrefabInstance` instead of `PrefabUtility.GetPrefabInstanceStatus == NotAPrefab`. This eliminates known false-negative cases (non-root children, instances with missing nested assets) where scene GameObjects that are valid prefab instances were reported as "not a prefab instance". Contributed by [@BadranRaza](https://github.com/BadranRaza) in [#8](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin/pull/8).
- **Bridge server started in AssetImportWorker subprocesses** — Unity spawns batch-mode `AssetImportWorker` subprocesses for parallel asset import, and these were running the plugin's `[InitializeOnLoad]` constructor and claiming ports in the 7890-7899 range on top of the main Editor. A single user with a few projects open could easily exhaust the range, blocking legitimate editor instances. `MCPBridgeServer` now early-returns when `Application.isBatchMode` is true.
- **Infinite retry loop on port exhaustion** — When no port was available, `MCPInstanceRegistry.FindAvailablePort()` returned `PortRangeStart` (7890) by default; `MCPBridgeServer.Start()` then retried via `EditorApplication.delayCall`, hit the same default, and looped forever, spamming `Failed to start on port 7890`. `FindAvailablePort()` now returns `-1` when nothing is free, and `Start()` gives up cleanly. Fixes [unity-mcp-server#10](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/10).

### Changed
- **Declared minimum Unity version corrected** — `unityRelease` bumped from `0f1` to `18f1`. The plugin has been using `Object.FindObjectsByType` (introduced in Unity 2021.3.18) for several releases, so the declared minimum was inaccurate. No effective support window change.
